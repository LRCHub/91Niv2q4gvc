Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go, oh
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because-

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you
Boy, you've got me blinded
Oh, pretty, baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
That's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, oh, baby, baby, ay-ay-yeah
Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go-oh-oh
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here, and give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me, baby, one more time
My loneliness is killing me (is killing me now)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
And give me a sign, hit me, baby, one more time
